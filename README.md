* Made two seperate character controller scripts, one that uses horizontal and vertical and another that uses Mouse X and Mouse Y (I had to edit it in the project settings to make it work with IJKL
* I edited the Jump on both scripts to get keydown on S and K and made it so you can't go Backwards by pressing those keys.
* I added a seperate object above the players to count the leap frog points
* I have two scripts managing the point system so they can be displayed correctly
* I made it so you can easily see what is going on in the arena  by lowering the walls but made the colliders bigger
